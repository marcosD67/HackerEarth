*Note: The monthly circuits on HackerEarth are a week long and they have problems of different difficulties!
If you really want to focus on one question and get a solution, this competition allows you to! (For more information, please visit the HackerEarth website and view the upcoming May Circuits).

April's edition of Circuits had a good variety of problems! One of the first problems they dropped turned out to be
one of the harder problems of the whole contest, which is unusual. 
Total Points: 406
Rank: 536th out of 9518 people
I fully solved four of the 8 problems this circuits, so please feel free to look at my approaches to these problems and 
maybe learn from them if these problems eluded you during the competition 
(or if you have critiques for me in order to write cleaner code, I'd appreciate that!).
