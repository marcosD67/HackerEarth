Good start to the 2021 competitive programming grind for me! I am many times better than I was
at this point a year ago (my placings show that)

Final Ranking: 66th place
Final Score: 310
Also, I was the first to solve the Maximum Profit problem, but HackerEarth glitched and gave someone who
solved the problem 2 minutes after me 137/100 points, so he got the official credit on HackerEarth :(
