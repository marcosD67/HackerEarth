Note: There is an Easy competition every month, typically on the first week! It is the most
beginner friendly competition available on HackerEath, so please join! It's a good chance to improve your logic and skills. 

This May Edition of the Easy competitions, I managed to achieve my best position in a HackerEarth competition ever!
Total Points: 368
Rank: 53rd out of 1577 registered participants.
Please take a look at my solutions to see what I was thinking during this competition. I have since gone back and read the editorial
to all of these questions, but I wanted to upload my competition-only submissions!
