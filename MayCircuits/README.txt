This month's edition of the monthly Circuits competition saw me break a record for the amount of points I've gotten in a circuits! I also 
had my best solution to an approximation problem (customers.py), although it did lose points as time went on as people figured out it was
a CPU Job Scheduling problem. Please feel free to look at my solutions for these problems and comment better approaches to them!
